## Code Overview

- HTML semantics, or as close as I could manage, were maintained. I tried very hard to keep the HTML as simple and organized as possible. Admittedly, there might be a few ineffeciencies within it.
- Java Script was only connected for practice as we are just beginning to learn this in the course.
- Wireframe'd the mockup and structured everything off of that. I see that ahead in the course we will have the opportunity to rework our portfolio's so for this attempt, I tried to keep the code as straightforward and true to specs as possible.
- Responsiveness: As hard as I tried, I was unable to make the page 100% responsive, particularly to screen sixes common on smaller devices. The addition of media query may be able to resolve this. However, I was not able to get a querie to work without breaking the code. In the future, my effort will be spent on first creating the code to display on the smallest possible viewport, which I believe will make the responsiveness issue much less of an issue on larger devices.
- For the links to deployed applications; at this point, I do not have any deployed applications. Instead, I linked the buttons in my work section to public github repositories I created. Some with homework assingments, others empty.

## Summary

- The portfolio correctly responds to all the prompts in the user story as closely as possible.

## CSS style

- Inefficiencies in CSS style are definitely present. However, this was personally a huge step up from anything I have attempted before in the platform and as I styled, I was able to eliminate a good deal of redundancies. The CSS Style, while not perfect, represents a large step forward in my personal ability.
